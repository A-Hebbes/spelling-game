# There, Their, or They're Spelling Game 

This is a website tagetted at children but which can be used by any English language learner, to help practice their skills with the tricky there, their, or they're homophone. The aim of the site is to provide guidance on the spelling skill whilst also allowing the user to test their understanding. There is also a contact form on the website in case users have any comments for improvements which could be made.

**The Footer**

- The footer has links to social media and a copyright notice. The links open the social media pages in a different link so that the user can remain on the Rocks Off page. 

- This is of use to the user as it helps them to engage with Rocks Off on other media. 

- Having links to social media allows the centre to market to, and communicate with, users.

### Features left to implement 

- The site could also include a gear shop online in the fuuture. This would complement the on-site gear shop mentioned in the facilities box in the about us section. 

- Social media links direct to the social media main page as there are no social media addresses for teh site. 

-The form action is set to email@rocksoff.com because there is nowhere for the data to be sent to.
