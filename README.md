# There, Their, or They're Spelling Game 

This is a website tagetted at children but which can be used by any English language learner, to help practice their skills with the tricky there, their, or they're homophone. The aim of the site is to provide guidance on the spelling skill whilst also allowing the user to test their understanding. There is also a contact form on the website in case users have any comments for improvements which could be made.

**General Information Section**

![rocks-off-about](https://github.com/A-Hebbes/Project-1-Rocks-Off/assets/148571629/b1f2c839-de1a-46d8-8c46-39a7e326ddff)

- There is an 'about us' section which gives information about the centre. This section aims to answer some questions which users may have whilst also exciting an interest in using the facilities. 

- There is a 'story' section that gives a bit of a story about the centre's background. The 'walls' section gives specific information about what climbing there is available. Then the final section is about the general facilities that the club has on offer. These are facilities that will increase convenience and comfort of users and so are good to mention here. 

- The background image is a close up of hands belaying. This is to again reinforce the purpose of the page. It also serves to emphasise that Rocks Off is not just a bouldering centre, but also has roped climbing opportunities. 



**Opening Times and Prices Section**

- This section lays out the opening times and prices information in tables. 

- The information is clearly laid out and the tables are close together, which allows for ease of use. 

- This section could be updated as times change or as more membership options become available.

**Contact Us Section**

-Users are requested to input their name and email. This is to ensure that communications can be responded to effectively. 

- Radio buttons are used to gain more information about what sort of query the user is messaging about. 

- There is a selector to find out more about the user's climbing experience. This will allow Rocks Off to provide coaching offers that are relevant to the experience level of users. 

- There is a feedback text area so that the user can type their message. 

- The button to send the form has the text 'send it' this is to fit with the climbing vernacular further emphasising the purpose of the site.

**The Footer**

- The footer has links to social media and a copyright notice. The links open the social media pages in a different link so that the user can remain on the Rocks Off page. 

- This is of use to the user as it helps them to engage with Rocks Off on other media. 

- Having links to social media allows the centre to market to, and communicate with, users.

### Features left to implement 

- The site could also include a gear shop online in the fuuture. This would complement the on-site gear shop mentioned in the facilities box in the about us section. 

- Social media links direct to the social media main page as there are no social media addresses for teh site. 

-The form action is set to email@rocksoff.com because there is nowhere for the data to be sent to.
