            <p class="space-below">Let’s recap the three words and their meanings: 'there,' 'their,' and 'they're.'
                'There' is for places, like 'I want to go there.' 'Their' is for things that belong to people, such as
                'It's their toy.' And 'they're' is just a quicker way of writing 'they are,' like saying 'They're going
                to the park.'</p>
            <p>That’s all there is to it, 'there' for places, 'their' for belonging, and 'they're' for they are."</p>
